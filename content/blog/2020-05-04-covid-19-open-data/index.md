Covid-19 has changed all of our lives. For researchers in particular, field and lab based research may not be possible, derailing lives and long-term research projects. However, if you still have internet service, you can conduct research with the massive amount of open data available.

What it takes to do research using open data probably will not require new skills beyond what most researchers already know. Instead of using primary research data collected in the field or lab however, researchers can instead use open data as their starting point.

some other text ...?

rOpenSci packages make open data easy to incorporate into your reproducibile R workflow. What R packages do we have and how much and what data do they provide? We'll answer these questions below.

## A lot of data

<!-- Below we'll cover a variety of research areas (see _Thematic Areas_),  -->

rOpenSci packages give R users access to a whole lot of data. For illustrative purposes, here are a few of the packages we have covering a variety of different thematic areas:

Biology

* [rentrez][]/[phylotaR][]/[biomartr][]: very brief description of data size
* [rgbif][]: very brief description of data size
* [taxize][]: very brief description of data size

Social science

* [essurvey][]: very brief description of data size
* [comtradr][]: very brief description of data size

Climate/Spatial

* [MODIStsp][]: very brief description of data size
* [rnoaa][]: very brief description of data size

Chemistry

* [webchem][]: very brief description of data size

Economics

* [skynet][]: very brief description of data size


## Thematic Areas

We've invited some rOpenSci community members to summarize packages for accessing open data in each of a number of thematic areas. The thematic areas are: water, Antarctica, ecology, biodiversity, taxonomy, space and weather, and text-mining.

_for each thematic area:_

### Water

## This is where you come in

We want graduate students, postdocs, and their advisors to see real life success stories where publications have come out of using open data (_as a chapter that's part of a lab or field research thesis? have to clearly frame the niche - what kinds of examples do we NOT want?_) 
**Are you an academic - advisor or advisee** - who has used one or more of these data sources in your research?
Comment on this post to share your story or add it to our [discussion forum use cases category][]. 

**Need help?** (_need to say what kind of help here?_)
Ask your question in our [discussion forum packages category][]. 
If your question is about a specific package, add the package name as a tag. 
(_need to clarify use of questions vs packages categories_)

**What’s missing?** Is there an data source you need to access programmatically but there’s no R package to do that? 
We want to build robust tools for things people actually need. Add your request to our wishlist. 
(_need to have wishlist ready for this. Stef to follow up_)

**Do you maintain one of these tools?** 
Comment on this post to tell people more, point to tutorials or a blog post about it, or let them know where they can ask you questions.

**Are you developing an R package to access an open data source** and you’d like people to know about it?
Post to our [discussion forum packages category][].
Consider submitting the package for [software peer review][].
